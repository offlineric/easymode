# Browser css
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [Fl√®che](https://github.com/hdni/Fleche) theme by hdni. 

### Firefox
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [FXChrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) theme.
* Install the [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/) extension.
* Install the [lesschrome modified](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lesschrome-modified/) extension.
* RESTART FIREFOX
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of browser_style.css.
* Seriously restart firefox if it looks wrong. If it still looks wrong after that, I guess you can use the issues tracker.

* Customize toolbar and place the home button immediately to the left of urlbar or else it won't look closed on that side. 

#4chan css
Forked from and eentirely inspired by the brilliant [ribbon style](https://github.com/hdni/user-styles) again by hdni.

### 4chan
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension.
* Install the latest [4chan-x](http://seaweedchan.github.io/4chan-x/) from seaweed and zixaphir.
* Install 4chan_userscript.user.js in greasemonkey.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of 4chan_style.css.
* If it looks wrong you can try saving and importing my 4chan_x_settings.json file in to your 4chan-x.

###Other recommended firefox extensions
* Download Statusbar
* Status-4-evar
* Moveable firefox button
* Yet another smooth scrolling

## Notes
* This theme is not complete yet, and still has bugs. If you find any, please feel free to fix them yourself ;) and send me your patches.
* To resize history or various other panels you have to remove the last line of the style (#splitter {display none})
