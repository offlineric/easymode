# Browser css
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [Fl√®che](https://github.com/hdni/Fleche) theme by hdni. 

### Firefox
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [FXChrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) theme.
* Install the [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/) extension.
* Install the [Mozilla labs lesschrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/prospector-lessChrome-HD/) extension.
* RESTART FIREFOX
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of [browser_style.css](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/easymode/master/browser_style.css). Or [browser_style_light.css](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/easymode/master/browser_style_light.css) if you prefer.
* Seriously restart firefox if it looks wrong. If it still looks wrong after that, I guess you can use the issues tracker.

* Customize toolbar and place the home button immediately to the left of urlbar or else it won't look closed on that side. 

#4chan css
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [ribbon style](https://github.com/hdni/user-styles) again by hdni.

### 4chan
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension.
* Install the latest [4chan-x](http://seaweedchan.github.io/4chan-x/) from seaweed and zixaphir.
* Install [4chan_userscript.user.js](https://github.com/offlineric/easymode/raw/master/4chan_userscript.user.js) in greasemonkey.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of [4chan_style.css.](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/easymode/master/4chan_style.css)
* If it looks wrong you can right click on [this](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/easymode/master/4chan_x_settings.json) and save it as 4chansettings.json, then import the settings in to your 4chan-x from the settings dialog.

#Other recommended firefox extensions
* [Download Statusbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/download-statusbar/)
* [Status-4-evar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/status-4-evar/)
* [Moveable firefox button](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/movable-firefox-button/)
* [Yet another smooth scrolling](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/)

## Notes
* This theme is not complete yet, and still has bugs. If you find any, please feel free to fix them yourself ;) and send me your patches.
* To resize history or various other panels you have to remove the last line of the style (#splitter {display none}) 

## People I climbed over on my way to the top
* Big ups to [Adam Whitcroft](http://adamwhitcroft.com/) for the batch icons, used heavily in the 4chan style.
* Also much thanks to [Sax](https://github.com/saxamaphone69) for advice and generally being better at everything than I am.
* Of course the illustrious [Seaweed Chan](https://github.com/seaweedchan) and his partner in crime [Zixaphir](https://github.com/zixaphir/) for the amazing 4chan-x.
* And absolutely none of this would be possible without [hdni](https://github.com/hdni) and his absolutely magnificent styles and vision. 

#The Results
![Firefox and 4chan should look like this when you finish](https://raw.github.com/offlineric/easymode/master/Screenshot%20from%202013-06-26%2009:06:55.png "The Results")
* Firefox and 4chan should look like this (except for the window borders) when you finish.
